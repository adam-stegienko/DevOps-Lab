# Adam Lab

#### Project Overview

This is a DevOps Lab set-up that I created for the purpose of CI pipeline learning. The whole environment consists of three elements: Jenkins application (CI pipelines), GitLab repository (Source Code Management), and JFrog artifactory (artifact repository).

Usage: Set up the environment by running "init.sh" script.
